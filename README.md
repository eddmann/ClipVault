# ClipVault

A secure, privacy-focused clipboard manager for macOS.

## Overview

ClipVault automatically captures, encrypts, and organizes your clipboard history. Unlike traditional clipboard managers, ClipVault prioritizes security by encrypting all clipboard content at rest using AES-256-GCM encryption stored in the system Keychain.

When active:

- All clipboard content is automatically captured and encrypted
- Rich text formatting (RTF) is preserved
- Source application tracking with native app icons
- Instant visual feedback with animated notifications
- Smart filtering prevents sensitive content from being captured

## Features

- Automatic clipboard monitoring - Captures all clipboard changes in real-time
- Military-grade encryption - AES-256-GCM encryption with keys stored securely in macOS Keychain
- Smart sensitive content filtering - Automatically detects and excludes passwords, API keys, credit cards, and SSH keys
- Application-based exclusions - Block clipboard captures from password managers and other sensitive apps
- Real-time search & filtering - Instantly search through clipboard history
- Pin important items - Keep frequently used snippets at the top permanently
- Visual copy/paste notifications - Animated on-screen feedback for copy and paste actions
- Auto-paste functionality - One-click paste without manual keyboard commands
- Source app tracking - See which app each clipboard item came from with native icons
- View All window - Browse and manage large clipboard history with advanced filtering
- Rich text support - Preserves bold, italic, colors, and other formatting
